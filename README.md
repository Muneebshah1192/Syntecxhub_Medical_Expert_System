# Rule-Based Medical Expert System (AI)
**Internship Project for Syntecxhub**

## 🚀 Overview
A web-based AI diagnostic tool built during my internship at Syntecxhub. It uses **Forward Chaining** logic to analyze symptoms and provide a diagnosis based on a percentage confidence score.

## 🧠 Core Algorithm
The system calculates results using the following logic:
$$\text{Confidence} (\%) = \left( \frac{\text{Matched Symptoms}}{\text{Total Required Symptoms}} \right) \times 100$$

## ✨ Features
* **Nipah Virus Detection**: Specialized rules for neurological symptoms.
* **Modern UI**: Searchable multi-select dropdown for easy input.
* **Inference Logs**: Transparent reasoning path for every diagnosis.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Backend:** Python & Flask
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Tom Select)
